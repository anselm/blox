# BASIC EXAMPLES

- general editor - destructors
- general editor - property sheet editor for geo

	- beabove: -> write a separate action power that can be on a child -> beabove:0 would be the ground
	- face towards: -> test i guess that can also be on a child - test that concept
	- xrcamera -> write / decorate an object with this capability so that we can do real collisions in xr space
	- make sure i can texture cubes etc; the basics - add several basic examples

	- minor
		- examine on_tick event propagation closely
		- handle resizing

	- xr support

		- xr camera has to move a real object; ieed some concept of a real object

		- the xr picking needs to be moved out of the behaviorrenderer

		- xrcamera: makes the object go to the camera - or maybe on the ground at the camera?

		- [xr anchors] image, geo, user created

		- xr placement edit move

		- improve tightness/rate of movement

		- high fidelity text

		- vr movement and ar movement with a body

		- desktop orbit camera

	- recovering some of the arpersist powers; multi-player, editing, a map view, login?

	- recruiting people to improve it

	- a pass on small bug fixes and general featurizing; I've touched many things but not really filled them out as best I can

		- [effects] having a big tree with particles coming from it <<<< effects need to emit more gracefully I need an emit start offset

		- [text] -> show text that is ALWAYS legible, and ALWAYS in front of you -> maybe arrows also

		- [tamagotchi] have a pet that you have to feed, and that hops around on the ground - stays on ground

		- [image tag] have something attached to an image, have an image force a scene transition

		- [transition] have a scene transition -> ie, recognizing an image sends a message that can be used to force a transition

		- *[multiplayer] *[hosted on glitch]

	[WebXR Powers]

		- [gazed based placement with ray - test more]

		- [gaze based highlighting]

		- [gaze based dragging]

		- [gaze based editing]

# OTHER

	- can i take a sentence and turn it into letters and then turn those letters into particles and then blow it up?
	- sound! can i also do sound synthesis and wire sound things together?

	- scene startup; blair says scenes should start in front of player but that fights multiplayer ideas
	- multiplayer; think harder about this

	- need a virtual hand
	- need some real world placement of objects; can i make a demo of that? pull in arpersist power?

	- demonstrate a smart card, templated, super rich and super beautiful; examine lifecards
	- make a powerpoint on this whole app

	- animate the gltfs
	- i would like an orbit camera than can attach to other kinds of cameras
	- i would like to fix up the camera so it does not flicker



****


	x try load behaviors by name -> revisit this idea later... some issues right now with paths or something

	- right now camera pose does get overridden by webxr, but i would also it to control a physical object like me for proximity
		- letting you use the camera pose to also position an object
		- letting you have a hand on the front of the camera; i guess this is similar...

	- [search and namespaces] consider renaming all objects into a named hierachy

	- right now collision is a built in feature, could it be made something more specialized?

	- webxr
		- only send messages in general and on_tick to active objects, so have a deeper concept of active or not
		- when i recognize an image send an event so that i can toggle scenes off and on
		- 

	- behaviornetwork
		on_tick
			- broadcast changes periodically
		- some simple multiplayer
		- what are strategies to get two players to see each other?
				- they could just share their local coordinate system directly...
					- slightly different elevations and orientations... that's just the way it is?
					- objects might pop as their authoritative position is changed due to anchor changes...
				- maybe common objects in both worlds like a qrcode could be used as a parent of any other objects


	- rename "on_*" to "do_*" ? as in do_reset or do_goto or do_event? just for clarity?
		i am now specially reserving the word on_* to look for events...

	- I did want to copy blox.functions.on_something handlers directly up to blox.on_something ...
		this would purely be nice for document level scripting, it makes it simpler to say "thing.do_something"

	- small but curious bug with camera declaring blox.mesh - study?

	 - could shorten the name to the various BehaviorAction* utilities... and also maybe not pollute Blox namespace so much

	 - change behaviorwalk to use new impulse method and remove impulse hacks from behavioraction

	 - kinematic motion model improvements
		- tends to keep sliding sideways; i really want something that feels more precise for the pov movement; like set destination
		- destinations tend to be overshot in the ik model
		- should really use real physics engine again; and integrate physics with my motion model too

	 - continue to improve semantic choreography

			This tries to strike a balance between high level story telling and simplicity in a declarative grammar.
			It will probably have a lot of verbs.
			It's currently merged with sequencing of events over time - which arguably it should be distinct from

			The approach I've been taking is to define a BehaviorIntent which accepts a single event filled with lots of hints.
			The event can be a single request or an array of requests - that get played back over time.
			These are the powers I want:

			linear kinematic
				* accelerate in general

			linear inverse kinematic
				* go to entity
				* go to xyz
				* be at a height regardless of other stuff, like a height above ground
				- go to be in front of player
				- go behind (player sets what is behind)
				- go above (look at thing and get height)
				- go below
				- go generally nearish
				- be pinned to a wall at a height at a position

			angular
				* face forward [ this is not working as well as I would like although it does work ]
				- face a certain direction
				- face a relative direction (look left) waggle
				- face player ( billboard )
				- tilt { for waddling, or cartoon effects - like tilt left or tilt right }
				- spin in general

			collision?
				- fire an event when goal is reached?

			- other ideas -> waddle, tilt, spin, follow nearest person, avoid each other


	 - choreography of groups [ LOWER PRIORITY RIGHT NOW ]

		- the easiest way to time things is just write code
		- i don't want to replace javascript, but i want to pull out or emphasize the timeline itself
		- so where appropriate a grammar can be story level?
		- i want to separate verbs from nouns, so they can be applied to anything or i can group or find similar things
		- mass or group behavior - make 50 things do one dance together
		- any reasonable separation of behavior from being overly bound to objects
		- I'd like to be able to have a sequence or program made up out of successive intentions; a choreography
		- maybe i can give these little sequences names and save them the same way i save meshes and then refer to them like macros
		- although branching and turning completeness is risky, maybe events and resets are reasonable so a thing can loop behavior

		// a live query

		group = blox.query({monsters,all})
		group.add_behavior(intent) // - if i could save behaviors for later, and then apply them by reference this is doable


	 - gltf load consolidation to avoid duplicate loads?




# - a a story to try

	- the turtle story
		- a person appears on the ground, in front of you
		- can you help me find my turtle
		- you have to tap on the text box
		- hereâ€™s a picture!
		- he wandered off!
		- and then you can look around and try find it? i guess?
		- and if you tap it then you get some end sequence? 

# - DOCS -> should put these somewhere

		Blox
			behaviors
			functions
			group
			<- behaviors also appear directly in the namespace - a blox with a BehaviorScene can be dereferenced blox.scene
			<- variables also get added here, there are some conventions

		Behaviors

			Scene
			Camera
			Light
			Mesh
			Audio

			Sky
			Heart
			Text
			* halfdome tbd

			Hand

			Anchor

			Action
			Physics
			Bounce
			Collide
			Emitter



# - [DONE] BehaviorAction event pipeline improvements

	You can decorate a blox with a BehaviorAction which brings in a bunch of related Behaviors. I want to tidy this up.

	- right now I decorate the parent blox with a bunch of conventions that are assumed and implicit...
		it would be nicer to have some formalism for when I'm decorating a blox with anything at all....

	- right now all of the action properties are fairly naked and simple such as

		action: {
			position:{x:0,y:10,z:0},
			velocity:{x:0,y:10,z:0},
			friction:0.9
			force:{name:"gravity",x:0,y:-1,z:0,friction:0,impulse:false},
			disperse:{radius:50},
			//nozzle:{axis1:-50,axis2:50,spin1:0,spin2:360},
			//speed:{min:0.4,max:0.5,end:-1}, // minimum start speed, maximum start speed, ending speed if any }
			color_gradient:{min:0x00ff0000,max:0x00ff0000,end:0x00000000}, // minimum color, maximum color, end color
			scale_range:{min:1,max:1,end:0},
			tumble:1,
			lifespan:{min:100, max:150}

		if instead i force bundle them with their associated Behavior, then this could also solve another problem
		of attaching behaviors that I don't need. I'd like to do something more like this

		action: {
			kinetic: {
				position:
				velocity:
				friction:
				force:
				disperse:
				nozzle:
				speed:
				color:
				tumble:
				lifespan:
			},
			goal: {
				target:
				height:
				forward:
				faces:
			}

		and then i can not only spawn the right behavior, but i can direct the right events
		it becomes a way to talk to a behavior by name... and this could be a deeper more useful pattern
		right now i talk to a behavior based on what it has published as a listening method
		i would like instead to be able to simply talk directly to a behavior
		that is to say, behaviors can always listen to any events
		but it would be nice to have directed events


# [ DONE ] Usability feature - make it so that users don't have to declare a child group at all

	at the moment the parent blox namespace is directly polluted with behaviors and functions
	it might be nice to pollute it with children blox as well because this would make it easier for users to work in text
	so instead of

			{
				name:"parentblox",
				color:0xff0000,
				on_loaded:function(e) { console.log("i was loaded") }
				group: [
					{
						name:"childblox",
						color:0x00ff00,
						on_goto:function(e) { console.log("goto something") }
					}
				],
			}

	it would become this - which could be dangerous because now behaviors and blox are colliding - but easier

		{
			name:"parentblox",
			color:0xff0000,
			on_loaded:function(e) { console.log("i was loaded") }
			childblox:{
				color:0x00ff00,
				on_goto:function(e) { console.log("goto something") }
			}
		}

	and also i would expose this now as

		parent.childblox.color etc

	at the moment if i don't find a behavior i promote the thing to be a literal, but instead i could try treat it as a blox
	still it would be nice to have both literals and behaviors - it is not clear how to have both easily...
	i can tell functions apart by the keyvalue, i can tell behaviors apart by the reserved name on the key
	i cannot tell some literals apart - unless i disallow hashes as literals, or disallow literals entirely?

# [ DONE ] event chains and gathering up of events

	there's a pretty deeply woven idea that most activity in this system is event driven, and events percolate to named handlers
	this is so that users who work directly on documents can decorate a blox or a behavior with a handler and do work
	also programmers who build behaviors can decorate behaviors with handlers

	but what if i grab every event that i see - and push them up to the blox itself as event chains?
	so they are all still called, in the right way, but now i can support buckets of them - ordinary events like on_goto()

	right now events are distributed on blox themselves

	+ basically i want the blox itself to be the thing you talk to
	+ and i want to be able to call naked functions on the blox if the child had that function
		so although normally you can do
			myblox.intent.goto("mary")
		i would like
			myblox.goto("mary")

		and the only way i can see to do that is to promote the events up to the parent blox, scavenging them from the behavior
		and since everybody has their own events i have to have event chains...
		but if i did this then now blox become more powerful and more generic; they are imbued with the derived child methods

# [DECIDED/DONE] raw event arguments versus events always being a hash of properties - decided in favor of hashes

	- there is also a bit of a question about buckets of event arguments...

		i kind of would like to be able to do 

			joe = query(find a blox named joe)
			joe.on_goto("mary")

		but unnamed arguments are a hassle because events percolate generically with rollups of args and .blox is declared
		for example what looks like a single param is actually injected with the parent scope as a hint

			joe.goto({destination:"mary",blox:blox})

		that said... i could use the "this" operator and bind the parent blox to the behavior and then have unrolled args...

			function goto(...args) {
				this typeof BehaviorIntent
				this.blox typeof Blox
			}

		which is what most programmers would expect and be happy with

		* honestly I should probably stick with hashes but ALSO set the 'this' and the parent 'blox' correctly everywhere.
			AND ALSO pass the parent blox and the behavior as arguments
			AND userland functions that are naked - declared directly in the documents - I can bind(parentbehavior) on

# [DONE] packages

	[ kinda done? ]

	- demonstrate loading a scene off disk dynamically, and loading just a blobs contents also
		- maybe ignore the second â€™sceneâ€™ if it shows up? should scene be special?

	- packages?- does not really handle children though? maybe it does?

# [DONE] 2d UX (good enough for now)

UX capabilities - Design Thoughts May 1 2019

It is not totally clear to me if 2D UX elements should be done IN ThreeJS or just exploit the power of the DOM.
I decided that exploiting the full DOM is better and a good exercise.

It's also not clear to me if a Behavior should be this specialized or abstract.
Arguably a sufficiently rich json file could declare all of the UX and behavior here.
In this case I decided I might as well consolidate it as a behavior - it could be part of an editor UX.

It's not clear if it should add itself directly to the DOM or should have a router.
Probably a shared router is a good idea but for now I'll just add it directly here.

It's not clear if it should talk to the anchor system or XR features at all?
I think I am leaning towards producing a blox and then letting that blox update itself.
That would reduce the burden on this code from knowing anything.
Also this code is not making the blox inside the on_tick method so it doesn't have access to the renderer easily.

I think the right idea is to just make a blox right now - from a description?
Maybe blox can have property sheet schemas so that they can be generically edited.

- later pull up an editor - for now just make the default
